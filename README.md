## TCrypt


</div>

### Description

Tcrypt has no text formatting available now but the encryption doesn't stuff up and random numbers are used (they work like a key, you need the same number to decrypt it) to make sure the encryption will look different every time. It has a multiple document interface and Encrypt and Decrypt buttons with a progress bar.

Please vote since i made this only to put on this page.
